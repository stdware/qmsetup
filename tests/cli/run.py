"""Runs the whole qmcorecmd suite by hand.

    python tests/cli/run.py <qmcorecmd> [<fixture directory>]

Everything the tests need is named by an environment variable, so that the
build system decides on it rather than the test code guessing:

    QMCORECMD        the executable under test
    QMTEST_FIXTURES  where the fixture binaries were built, for the deploy
                     tests. Without it those skip themselves
    QMTEST_SCENARIOS the deploy declaration to read

This script fills in whichever of them were not set already. Under CTest they
all are, and this script is not involved.
