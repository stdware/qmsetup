# driver this one goes all the way through. The project has a check.cmake beside
# it, which is included at the end and is what does the asserting.

# A project with nothing to install has nothing installed, the step passing over
# it quietly, so a test that only needs a build needs nothing special.

# These are the slowest tests in the directory by a long way.
